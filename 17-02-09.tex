\begin{proposition}
	Let $K$ be a field of order $p^n$, then $K$ admits a unique sobfield of size $p^d,\forall d\mid n$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	Let $K', K''$ be two such subfields, Then
	$$K'=\{\mbox{roots of $x^{p^n-1}-x$ in $K$}\} = K''.$$For existence, let $K' = \{\mbox{roots of $x^{p^d}-x$}\}$, we just need to show $K'$ is a field. Clearly, $1,0\in K'$. Using $(x+y)^{p} = (x^p+y^p)$ in charateristic $p$ field $K'$, we can also show $K'$ is closed in addition, multiplication and division. Thus $K'$ is a field. Note that $d\mid n$ is necessary since we must have $x^{p^d}-x\mid x^{p^n}-x$, and that implies $d\mid n$.
\end{proof}
The general problem is that let $f(x)\in K[x]$ be a non-constant polynomial, can we construct an extension of $K$ such that $f(x)$ can be linearly factored? Let $L:=K[x]/(f(x))$, $f(x)$ is irreducible in $K$. We have
\begin{theorem}\mbox{}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $L$ is a field.
		\item In $L$, $f$ has a root, namely the class of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{theorem}
\begin{example}
	$\C = \R[x]/(x^2+1)$
\end{example}
\begin{exercise}
	Prove that $\R[x]/(x^2+1)$ is isomorphic to $\R[x]/(x^2+5)$.
\end{exercise}
\begin{proof}
	We apply the bijection $x\mapsto x/\sqrt{5}$.
\end{proof}
\begin{theorem}
	$[L:K] = \deg f$
\end{theorem}
\begin{corollary}
	$L=K[\al] = K(\al)$. $K[\al]$ is the ring generated by $K$ and $\al$. $K(\al)$ is the field generated by $K$ and $\al$.
\end{corollary}
